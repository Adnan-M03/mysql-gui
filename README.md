  Easily connect to databases on your local machine or remote servers.
- **CRUD Operations**  
  Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on databases and tables.

- **Multi-Tab Support**  
  Work across multiple databases or queries simultaneously, with a smooth and responsive interface.

- **Query Editor with Autocompletion**  
  Write queries faster with intelligent autocompletion and syntax highlighting.

- **Improved Pagination**  
  Navigate large datasets with optimized pagination.

- **Rich User Interface**  
  A dynamic and user-friendly interface designed to enhance productivity.

- **Dynamic Result Grid**  
  Visualize query results with a responsive, grid-based layout.

- **Basic Authentication**  
  Optional authentication for added security when running on remote servers.

- **Clipboard Copy**  
  Quickly copy cell data with a single click.

- **AI Integration**  
  Leverage OpenAI and Google Gemini for generating intelligent SQL queries. Talk to your selected Database

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16.0.0 or above**  
  Install Node.js from the [official downloads page](https://nodejs.org/). Alternatively, manage versions dynamically with tools like nvm on macOS, Linux, or WSL.

- **npm 8.0.0 or above**  
  npm is bundled with Node.js. To upgrade, use:
  ```bash
  npm i -g npm
  ```
- **MYSQL Server**
  A running MySQL server instance

## Installation

MYSQL GUI can be installed in multiple ways:

### From npm

1. Install globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g mysql-gui
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mysql-gui
   ```

### From npm

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kshashikumar/mysql-gui.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd mysql-gui
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### From Docker Hub

You can run MYSQL GUI using Docker for easy setup and deployment. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Running with Docker Compose

To run MYSQL GUI with Docker Compose, use the following `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  mysql-gui:
    container_name: "mysql-gui"
    image: shashikumarkasturi/mysql-gui
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_URL=mysql://root:root@host.docker.internal:3306
      - AI_MODEL=<Model Name> #gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-davinci-003, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-pro, gemini-lite
      - AI_API_KEY=<API Key>
```

### Steps to Run

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory and paste the configuration above.
2. Start the container using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start MYSQL GUI in detached mode, running in the background. 3. Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:5000> to use MYSQL GUI. 4. To stop the container, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## AI Integration

MYSQL GUI integrates OpenAI and Google Gemini to generate intelligent SQL queries with the following features:

### Setting Up AI Integration

To enable AI-powered prompt querying, you need to set up the API keys for OpenAI or Google Gemini:

1. **Obtain an API Key**
   - For OpenAI: Visit OpenAI's platform and generate an API key.
   - For Google Gemini: Follow Google's platform to obtain an API key (free tier provides 15 requests per minute).
2. **Add the API Key to Your Environment Variables**
   In the root directory of your project, create a .env file (or update it if it exists) and add the following lines:

```bash
AI_MODEL=<MODEL_NAME>  # e.g., gpt-4 or gemini-1.5-flash
AI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

3. **Restart MYSQL GUI**
   Restart the application to activate AI integration.

### Using AI Prompt Querying

- Enable AI from the user interface using the AI toggle button.
- Write a natural language query in the input box and click on AI Prompt button, AI will generate the corresponding SQL query.
- The AI can join tables, generate aggregated queries, and suggest optimal SQL syntax based on the database you selected.

**Example Workflow:**

1. Write a query prompt:
   `Find the average salary of employees in each department.`
2. The AI generates the SQL:

```bash
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary FROM employeerecords GROUP BY Department;
```

## Security Note

- Confidentiality: Never expose your .env file containing the API key.
- **Secure Connections**: Ensure your MySQL connections and API keys are used securely, especially in production.

### Environment Variables

- **MYSQL_URL**: Replace `mysql://root:root@host.docker.internal:3306` with the URL of your MySQL database if it's hosted elsewhere or has different credentials.

## Usage

By default, MYSQL GUI launches with the following configuration:

- **Database URL (-u)**: `mysql://root:root@localhost:3306`
- **Port (-p)**: `5000`

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

To connect to a different MySQL server, specify the database URL as follows:

```bash
mysql-gui -u mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<dbport>
```

### Options

- **-u**: Specify the database URL to connect to a MySQL instance.
- **-p**: Port number for MYSQL GUI to listen on
- **--model**: Specify the AI model to be used
  `(supporting model: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-davinci-003, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-pro, gemini-lite)`
- **--apikey**: Specify the API key for the chosen AI model.

## Basic Authentication (Optional)

Protect data with basic authentication when running on remote servers.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add the following variables

```bash
USERNAME=<your_username>
PASSWORD=<your_password>
```

3. Restart the server.

To disable authentication, comment out or remove these variables from `.env` and restart the server.

## Upcoming Features

- **Multi-Relational DB Support**: PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, Amazon Redshift, and more.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter data directly within result grids.
- **Result Limit Options**: Control the number of records displayed.
- **Enhanced AI Integration**: Leverage AI for complex query generation and analysis.
